        TARAKESWAR AFFAIR (1874) 
  
  Law Involved:
  Section 497 of the IPC 1860 defines Adultery and related punishment for it.
  Section 300 of the IPC defines murder and SECTION 302 describes its punishment.
  
  
  Introduction:
  The Tarakeswar affair deals with a public scandal in colonial Bengal in the 19th century. 
  This case involved an illicit love affair between Elokeshi, wife of Nobin Chandra, and the Mahant, head priest of Tarakeswar Shiva temple. This Affair was covered by every newspaper in 1973. The public opinion was that the Mahant’s actions were punishable and Nobin’s act of slitting his wife’s head was justified as in those times adultery was a more heinous crime than murder. Thus, due to public outrage, authorities were forced to release Nobin after two years only. This case became a popular theme for Bengali plays and Kalighat paintings which portrayed Nobin as a devoted husband, the Mahant as a womanizer, and Elokeshi as a seductress and the main cause of the affair. 
  
  
  Facts of the Case:
  ● The Tarakeswar murder involved three people- Elokshi, a minor girl married to Nobin, an upper-class Bengali with a job in the Military press, Calcutta and Madhavchandra Giri, chief priest of the Tarakeswar temple.
  ● Nobin had to leave his wife with her father in the village of Tarakeswar where she decided to seek fertility medication from the priest.
  ● The Mahant had allegedly seduced and raped Elokeshi which led to the beginning of an affair between the two.
  ● On 24th May 1873, Nobin returned to Kumrul and met his wife. He took her to her grandmother’s house where Elokeshi confessed to Nobin about her affair with the Mahant, after three days on 27th May 1873, Nobin slit Elokeshi’s throat and she died of excessive bleeding. 
  
  
  ● Nobin surrendered himself to the police and confessed that he had murdered his wife because she had an affair with the mahant.
  ● Both Nobin and the mahant were represented before the court for committing murder and adultery respectively.
  ● The Hooghly Session Court held that Nobin’s act was insane and that he was not in control of his senses when he became aware of his wife’s affair and held him not guilty.
  ● The same court in the trial against Mahant for adultery held that adultery was a criminal offense in British India and sentenced him to 3 years of imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 2000.
  ● Both the cases were appealed to the High Court of Calcutta. 
  
  
  Issues of the Case:
  Trial 1
  ● Whether Nobin was insane or not?
  ● Whether Nobin was clearly of unsound mind while committing the act or not?
  
  
  Trial 2
  ● Whether Nobin and Elokeshi were married was it a known fact or not?
  ● Did Nobin know about the affair and accept the same or not?
  ● Whether there was sufficient proof or evidence to tell; whether sexual intercourse had occurred between the defendant and Elokeshi or not?
  ● Whether the Mahant knew that Elokeshi was married or not?
  High Court Judgment: Trial 1
  ● The High Court admitted that there was no doubt that Elokeshi was killed by a fish knife (boti) by Nobin as he had confessed to it by himself.
  ● Regarding the question of insanity and loss of control, the court held that the defendant was not insane but had been excited. He acted under the influence of ‘anger, jealousy, and grief’ but was aware that what he was doing was wrong.
  ● The court declared Nobin sane and guilty of culpable homicide as there was no sufficient evidence to prove that he was insane and unable to think of the consequences of his actions.
  ● Thus, the High court quashed the decision of the session court and sentenced Nobin to transportation for life under section 302 of the Penal Code. 
  
  
  Trial 2
  ● The High Court upheld the decision of the Session Court and sentenced the Mahant to 3 years imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 2000.
  ● The court explained that adhering to Hindu Law, adultery was a criminal offense in British India. 
  ● The court also noted for proof that carnal intercourse took place between the Mahant and Nobin’s wife.
  ● The court accepted the testimony of three residents who confirmed that they saw Elokeshi entering the Mahant’s house in the evening and leaving it in the morning.
  ● Though it was not that strong of proof still the court accepted it and quoted the lines of Manu “A woman must never act independently of her husband.”
  ● At last, the court stated that they place the law above personal revenge and individual justice.
  
  
  Conclusion:
  The Tarakeswar case was one of the most popular and most controversial cases in British India. 
  This case caught people’s special attention as the adultery charges were against the Mahant of the Tarakeswar Temple. After the verdict of the Calcutta High Court, the native people forced the Governor-General to free Nobin as according to popular public opinion he has done nothing wrong in punishing his wife for her disloyalty. 
  The court’s decision was indeed correct as it was in accordance with the law of that time. The judgment was given without any influence by society. According to the media, the Tarakeswar case was popular to the extent that everyone could be heard talking about the incident.

      The murder of ghosts – Ram Bahadur Thapa (1959) 


Introduction
This is an appeal brought by the State of Orissa against an order of acquittal made by the Sessions Judge of Mayurbhanj in a case brought against the respondent under sections 302, 324, and 326 I.P.C. named Rum Bahadur Thapa. 
The Respondent was charged under Sec. 302 I.P.C. for the murder of Gelhi Majhiani, under Sec. 326 I.P.C. for having caused grievous hurt to P.Ws 27 and 28 and under Sec. 324 I.P.C. for having caused hurt to P.W. 26. The learned Sessions Judge decided to acquit the defendant based on Section 79 of the I.P.C. because he believed that the respondent committed the alleged crimes while acting in the mistaken belief that he was attacking ghosts rather than people.


Facts
● One Jagat Bandhu Chatterjee (P.W. 29) came to Rasgovindpur in Balasore district accompanied by his servant named Ram Bahadur Thapa in April 1958 for the purpose of purchasing the abandoned aerodrome’s aeroscrap. 
The area around it is infamous for being infested with ghosts. They both stayed in the house of Krishna Chandra Patro (P.W. 26), who was keeping a tea stall in the village.
● Jagat Bandhu Chatterji and his servant(Respondent) were anxious to see the ghosts. Hence at midnight, they persuaded Krishna Chandra Patro to accompany them to see the ghosts. They observed a flickering light in the distance as they were moving through camp No. IV.
● There was a strong wind blowing, and the movement of the light in that breeze created in them an impression that it was not an ordinary light. They discovered some specters roaming around the flickering light as well.
● The Respondent reached there first and began to attack the ghost with his his’Khurki’. Krishna Chandra Patro arrived there sometime later, but the respondent did not notice him, and one of his Khurki blows caused a severe injury to Krishna Chandra Patro, who screamed aloud.
● Other injured people began to scream out in pain at the same time, and the respondent ceased hitting the victims after that. It was found that the people he attacked and hurt were some local female Majhis who had gathered under a "Mohua" tree. hurricane lantern for the purpose of collecting ‘Mohua’ flowers.
● One Gelhi Majhiani was killed as a result of the respondent's indiscriminate attack, and two other women, Ganga Majhiani (P.W. 28) and Saunri Majhiani (P.W. 27), suffered severe injuries. Krishna Chandra Patro also sustained injuries.


Issues
● Whether the respondent acted without due care and attention.
● Is the respondent protected under Sec. 79 of I.P.C.
● Whether the question of good faith be considered with reference to the position of the accused and the circumstances under which he acts.


Judgements
● The High Court ruled that the defendant was protected by Section 79 I.P.C. since it could be reasonably inferred from the circumstances of how the apparition appeared before him and his predisposition that he thought he was fighting a ghost and not a person.
● It is clear that the respondent is protected by Section 79 I.P.C. based on the testimony of the prosecution witnesses.
● The fact that the incident may have been avoided if he had taken further precautions is not enough to disqualify him from the protection provided by that clause. As a result, the judgement of acquittal is upheld, and the appeal is dismissed.


Conclusion
According to the capability and intelligence of the individual whose action is under scrutiny, the appropriate level of care and caution must be determined. Regarding the accused's position and the circumstances surrounding his actions, the issue of good faith must be taken into account. No matter what position a person holds, the law does not seek the same level of care and attention from everyone.` },

      Renuka Shinde and Seema Gavit: The Infamous Child Killers (1990-1996)

Overview: Sisters Seema Mohan Gavit (born 1975) and Renuka Kiran Shinde (born 1973) are Indian serial killers convicted of kidnapping thirteen children and murdering five of them between 1990 and 1996. Along with their mother Anjanabai, they operated across several cities in western Maharashtra, including Pune, Thane, Kalyan, Kolhapur, and Nashik. Their motive for kidnapping was to use the children as distractions during thefts, where they would either invoke sympathy or create chaos if caught. The kidnapped children were subsequently killed.

Arrest and Conviction: The trio was arrested in November 1996, with Renuka’s husband, Kiran Shinde, later becoming an approver and receiving a pardon. Anjanabai died of illness within two years of their arrest, before the trial began. In 2001, the Kolhapur Sessions Court convicted the sisters for kidnapping thirteen children and murdering six. The Bombay High Court upheld the conviction in 2004 but acquitted them of one murder. The death sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court in 2006. After the rejection of their mercy petitions by President Pranab Mukherjee in 2014, the Bombay High Court commuted their death sentence to life imprisonment in 2022. The sisters are currently imprisoned at Yerwada Jail in Pune.

Background: Anjanabai, originally from Nashik, fled to Pune with a truck driver who deserted her after Renuka’s birth in 1973. Surviving by theft, Anjanabai later married Mohan Gavit, a retired soldier, and had Seema in 1975. Mohan eventually abandoned them, leading Anjanabai and her daughters to continue their criminal activities, often using the younger Seema as bait. Renuka married Kiran Shinde in 1989.

Crimes: In 1990, Renuka’s attempt to steal at the Chaturshringi Temple in Pune failed when she was caught. She escaped using her toddler son as a diversion. This incident inspired the family to use children as decoys in their thefts. Between 1990 and 1996, they kidnapped an estimated 40 children, mostly under five years old, from crowded places. They were charged with 13 kidnappings and 10 murders, with many cases potentially going unreported due to the victims' impoverished backgrounds.

Notable Murders:

Santosh: Their first murder victim was a child taken from Kolhapur, who was later killed in Pune after being injured during a theft attempt.
Two-and-a-half-year-old girl: Killed, stuffed in a bag, and dumped after a cinema visit.
Two-year-old boy: Hanged upside down and brutally killed.
Arrest and Trial: The investigation began after a complaint was filed by Pratibha, the second wife of Anjanabai’s former husband, who reported her daughter Kranti's kidnapping and murder. The trio was arrested on November 19, 1996, while attempting to kidnap another child. Evidence of their crimes was found at their residence in Nashik. Kiran Shinde’s testimony played a crucial role in the conviction. Anjanabai died before the trial, and the prosecution examined 156 witnesses.

Mercy Pleas and Commutation: Seema and Renuka filed mercy petitions in 2008 and 2009, respectively, which were rejected by President Mukherjee in 2014. They challenged the delay in processing their petitions, leading the Bombay High Court to commute their death sentences to life imprisonment in January 2022 due to the “gross and unexplained delay” in their case.

In Popular Culture:

The case was featured in the 2019 true-crime book The Deadly Dozen: India's Most Notorious Serial Killers by Anirban Bhattacharyya.
The 2019 Hindi film Posham Pa dramatizes the lives and crimes of the Gavit-Shinde family.` },

      K.M. Nanavati v/s State of Maharashtra (1961)
      
      This is a Landmark case in the criminal history of India as the case was held in 1959 by the Supreme Court of India where a Naval commander Kawas Mankeshaw Nanavati was accused of Murder of Prem Ahuja (his wife's paramour). And the judgement of this case was passed on 24th November 1961 but it is still fresh in the minds of people.

This case inspired several books and movies. There are some important legal points raised in this case such as plea of general exception, the burden of proof, sudden provocation test, power of high court in deciding the competence of reference made by Session Judge. Also, this case was the last case to be Judge by Jury Trail in India.

Petitioner: K.M. Nanavati v/s Respondant: State Of Maharashtra
Citation: Air 1962 Sc 605 - Date Of Judgment: 24 November, 1961
Bench: K. Subbarao, S.K. Das, Raghubar Dayal - Name Of Court: Supreme Court Of India

Laws And Acts Applied In The Case: Indian Penal Code,1860, Indian Evidence Act,1872, And Code Of Criminal Procedure,1898.

Facts
In this case accused K.M. Nanavati was second in command of Indian Naval ship. He married Sylvia in 1949 in the registry office at Portsmouth, England they have 3 children by the marriage a boy aged nine and half years, a girl of 5 and half years and another boy aged 3 year. Since the time of marriage, the couple was living at different places because of the nature of the job of Nanavati. Afterall, they finally shifted to Bombay.

Where they met Prem Ahuja and his sister through the Agniks the common friend of Ahuja's and Nanavati. As a Naval officer Nanavati was frequently going away from Bombay in his ship leaving his wife and children behind. In his absence of friendship developed between Sylvia and Ahuja which later on took the form of illicit relationship. On 18 April 1959 Nanavati returned from his ship. After returning he on several occasions tried to affectionate with his wife but she was behaving strangely to him.

On 27th April,1959 Sylvia tell Nanavati about her relationship with Ahuja. Due to this Nanavati angered and decided to settle that Matter with Ahuja. After this he drove his car to his ship and from there, he took a semi-Automatic revolver and six cartridges and put them in the brown envelope on the false pretax.



Then he went to Ahuja's Office, not finding him there Nanavati went to his house and he entered into the bedroom of Ahuja and shut it from inside. Nanavati asked Ahuja that he would marry sylvia and care after his children. Ahuja replied "Am I marry to every woman I sleep with?" Then a fight occurs between Ahuja and Nanavati, in this Nanavati shot Ahuja. After this he surrendered himself to nearby police station. Case was filed against K.M. Nanavati.

Issues:
Whether the accused shot Ahuja in grave and sudden provocation or whether it was a premediated murder?
Whether SLP can be entertained without fulfilling the order under Article 142? 3. Whether the pardoning power of governor and SLP move together?

Arguments
Petitioner's Argument
The argument made from petitioner's side is that when Nanavati heard about his wife's relationship with Ahuja, he wanted to commit suicide, but sylvia claimed she could clam him down. As sylvia did not mentioned that whether Ahuja would marry her or not and he plans to find out. So, he wanted to take medicine for his sick dog, and he left his wife and two of his children and one neighbor's child to cinema as well as promised to pick up them when show would end.

After this he went to his ship and told the ship authorities that he wanted to pull revolvers and six bullets from the stores of spacecrafts when driving alone to Ahmed Nagar at night. After receiving revolver and six cartridges, he put them in brown envelope. He drove his car to Ahuja's office but could not find him there. He drove his car to Ahuja's residence where the door opened by the Ahuja's servant and Nanavati walked into Ahuja's bedroom.

Where he carried the envelop with a revolver and he saw that Ahuja calling him dirty pig in the bedroom, he asked him that He would marry sylvia and take care of his children. Ahuja replied that "Am I marry to every woman I sleep with?" The accused angered and threatened to kill the deceased by putting envelope and a revolver in a nearby cabinet. The deceased suddenly took the action, and snatched the envelope, the accused said to take out therevolver and come back.



There was a fight between the two, and in that fight, two shots accidentally fell and killed Ahuja. After that shooting, the defendant returned to his car and went to the nearby police station to surrender. Therefore, the accusations against the dead were made with serious and sudden provocations, so even if you committed a crime it was not a murder, but a culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Respondent's Argument
The first argument made by respondent's lawyer is that Ahuja came out of the shower with a towel. When his body found in his bedroom then his towel was still intact. It does not come loose or fall from deceased body, and is extremely rare when a fight occurs. Also, after sylvia's confession, the accused calmed them down and gather his family, brought them to cinema, left them to cinema and then went to his store to take the revolver. This shows that he has enough time to calm down, the provocation is not serious or sudden, and that Nanavati planned the murder.

Also, according to Ahuja's servant, Anjani, who was at Ahuja's home at the time of incident and he was a natural witness, a total of four shots were made in succession, and the and entire incident took less than a minute, excluding attacks. Nanavati came out of Ahuja's room and did not explain to his sister Mamie that his sister was in another room in the flat. The deputy director also testified that Nanavati did not feel confused by acknowledging that Nanavati had shot Ahuja and even correcting the spelling of his name in the police records.

Judgment
Jury Trial
As the case first went to session court and where the jury trial was going on this case. In jury trial Nanavati was held not guilty with the verdict of 8:1under section 304 of Indian Penal Code,1860. But the Session Judge was not satisfied with the decision of jury trail and considered that decision as perverse and unreasonable and referred this case to Division Bench of Bombay High Court under Section 307 of the Code of Criminal procedure.

Verdict Of High Court
The High Court dismissed the verdict of the jury trial on the basis of following arguments made by the prosecutor
Sylvia's confession, or any specific incident in Ahuja's bedroom, or both did not amount to grave and sudden provocation.
The onus of proving that it was an accident and not premediated murder was on Nanavati.
The jury was not instructed that Nanavati's defence had to be proved, to the extent that there is no reasonable doubt in the mind of a reasonable person. And the accused was held liable under sec.302 of Indian Penal Code,1860. An Appeal was made by the accused under the supreme court of India and here is the verdict of Supreme Court.

Verdict Of Supreme Court
Supreme court said that bearing the principles in mind, we have to look into the facts of this case i.e.
As per the defence case, the accused was thinking of future of his wife and children, it implies that he had regained his senses.
The time lapse between the confession and murder was sufficient to regain his self control.
The mere fact that before the shooting the accused abused the deceased and abuse provoked an equally abusive reply could not conceivably be a provocation for murder.
The Supreme Court in second issue dismissed the SLP stating that he cannot claim it unless he surrenders under Article 142.
Supreme Court also held that the application made to the governor for pardon and the SLP cannot proceed parallelly. If SLP is filed, then power of governor in such case shall be ceased.
Supreme court held that the facts of the case don't attract the provisions of Exception 1.to sec. 300 of the Indian Penal Court. And the accused is guilty for the murder under Sec.302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentence of life imprisonment on accused passed by High Court is correct and also, held that there are no grounds for interference. And the Appeal was dismissed by Supreme Court.

Conclusion
This judgment created nationwide attention owning to the fact that the crime of adultery had resulted into murder not amounting to culpable homicide. The was also a high rank officer of the Navy and owning to this fact and pitiful coverage by media, such crime was socially accepted.

The burden of proof upon the prosecution was released by establishing the facts to utmost clarity. Also, referring the case to higher judiciary and jury being erroneous on point of law was something that pointed out amount of corruption in judiciary which resulted in abolition of jury system in succeeding Criminal Procedure Amendment in 1973.` },

      TANDOOR MURDERS

I. INTRODUCTION
What happens when you find your beloved partner engaged in a deep telephonic conversation with a person of opposite sex? You choose to shoot your partner in a fit of rage, chop the body into pieces, and to destroy the evidence you go ahead and burn the entire corpse in a “Tandoor”. This is what happened exactly in the case of Sushil Sharma and Naina Sahni.

Naina Sahni’s murder remains one of the most sensational cases for the criminal and justice system. Discovering a burnt body of a woman chopped into pieces in a tandoor of a restaurant in Delhi indeed shook the country’s conscience to a complete new level.

Sushil Sharma’s sudden fit of rage, the consequences that lead him to shoot his wife and then brutally burn her corpse in a tandoor, are discussed in details in this project report. Further in the project, the legal issues are discussed as was discussed in the court proceedings.

The accused was first awarded a death sentence by both the trial court and the Delhi High Court managed to stretch such a case close to a decade; and later the Supreme Court overruled the judgment commuting it to a life sentence.

The mystery is not the case but the fact that it took such a stretch of time to come up with a judgment. The project talks about various such parameters other than the facts of the case (though mentioned) which made this case’s final judgment a little too tough to digest.

*The comments made as the project proceeds are completely a perspective that I have had while reading the case, therefore, with all disclaimer applicable, this report.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Taxmann’s Criminal Major Acts:-
Indian Penal Code, Section 34 which says when a criminal act is done by several persons (in this case Sushil Sharma along with the employee of Bagia Bar-be- Que, Keshav Kumar), each having common intention have the same amount of liability as one would have had if done by one person alone. Also referring to Section 37, it says that if any kind of cooperation is done intentionally for committing a crime is also punishable as committing an offence. Chapter VA talks about Criminal Conspiracy in which section 120B highlights the punishment of the conspiracy which is either imprisonment or fine or both. From Chapter XI, Section 201 which talks about causing destruction/ disappearance of evidence, or giving false information to hide the offender, the offence of Keshav Kumar was understood.

A manual on Indian Evidence Act by Dr. Gokulesh Sharma and Hemant Kumar Pandey:-
Section 30 has been taken into from this book on Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which says when one or more persons are tried jointly for the same offence and a confession is made by one of them, and is proved, then the court may take into consideration such confession against both the tried persons.

Behind Bars: Prison Tales of India’s Most Famous by Sunetra Choudhury, Roli Books
The book effectively explains the most sensational criminals of India and their life behind bars. From the comfort of the life of a successful politician to a life of being a person in jail with other criminals, Sushil Sharma popularly known “Tandoor Sharma” explains how he lived his life inside. The way Sushil carefully planned his days inside in jail these 21 years of being behind bars gives the book an edge over other such kind. There are various comments made by him on the way the prison and its authorities function. Sharma states his strategies to deal the days in there for the next whatever years he is alive.  He was also one of the prisoners who were not out on parole for a stretch of 21 years straight. Sharma as mentioned in the book has also compared the American prison with that of India and how our system allows loopholes in the prison. Shocking yet a lot of true incidents are revealed from the prisoners in this book. The book talks about the class difference that exists in the prison.

III. FACTS OF THE CASE
The case is of a heinous murder of a wife (Naina Sahni) by the husband, Sushil Sharma, of course with the involvement of “Tandoor” which will be addressed in the later part of this section.

Starting with the background of both the deceased and the appellant; Sushil Sharma was the President of Delhi Youth Congress at the relevant time (1992), a commerce graduate from Delhi University. Naina Sahni (the deceased) also a Delhi University Graduate, was the former General Secretary of the Delhi Youth Congress Girls Wing.

It was said that Naina Sahni used to visit accused Sushil Sharma at the office of Youth Congress in New Delhi.

In the year 1992, accused Sushil Sharma obtained a flat at Mandir Marg where Naina Sahni used to visit frequently and at times “she used to stay back at night as well”, as said by the neighbors. Later, Sushil and Naina are said to have married in that residence “in their own way”, which suggests that they had a secret marriage[1] hidden from the public; however, the marriage had the consent of both the parties, Sushil and Naina, also including Naina Sahni’s parents. Thereafter, Naina continued to live in the said flat, claiming to be Sushil’s wife, till she was murdered.

Coming to the “Tandoor” part of the case, the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) which was running a unit called Ashok Yatri Nivas entered into a license agreement with Sushil Sharma and others for a restaurant called as the Bagia Bar-be-Que Restaurant.

Being a political figure Sushil Sharma wanted to keep their marriage a secret which was not accepted by Naina Sahni; also he suspected the character of his wife and restricted her freedom because of it. With growing tensions between the couple, Sushil and Naina’s married life became a strained one, where the wife was said to have been trying leaving the husband and moving to Australia with the help of her friend Matloob Karim (a fellow Congress worker and colleague).

ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER:-
After 3 years of their “secret” and strained marriage, on 2nd July 1995, Sushil Sharma reached his Mandir Marg flat to find Naina deep in conversation with somebody on the phone. On seeing Sharma, panicked Sahni disconnected the call. Suspicious, Sharma redialed the number after she ended the call and found that it was Matloob Karim, her fellow mate. Sushil Sharma suspected his wife having an affair with Mr. Karim. The marriage as stated was already strained as Sharma wanted to keep it a secret owing to his political ambitions. It was also known from neighbors that Sharma hit his wife regularly and spied his wife through their servant.

Enraged, Sharma took out his licensed revolver and shot Naina thrice, two bullets hitting her head and neck, and the third bullet struck the air conditioner. Sahni died on the spot.

In a fit of a rage, a crime was committed; justified. True, you suspect your partner having an affair, what a reasonable man would do is murder, but what comes next is what shook the legal and judicial fraternity to the next level.

Sharma then carried her body to the restaurant, covered in a black plastic, in the dickey of his Maruti car, which he owned, Bagia Bar-be-Que where he chopped the corpse into pieces and dumped it in the Tandoor. The execution of the Tandoor burning was carried out with the help of the co-accused Keshav Kumar (restaurant employee). Later the same person upon being interrogated by the police he claimed that, he “… was burning old Congress banners.”[2]

Meanwhile when the body was dumped in the barbeque, it released a huge amount of fire and smoke in the restaurant which attracted the attention of the passersby and also the people in the restaurant. Seeing the unusual fire and smoke, a police constable reports the situation to which police reach the restaurant. Meanwhile when the police was trying to figure out the cause of the fire in the restaurant, Sushil Sharma flees from the crime scene. The police noticed in the embers a human body particularly of a woman whose limbs tore apart and her intestines spilling out. Near the Tandoor was spotted black polythene and noticed bloodstains on it. Later, blood stains on Keshav’s clothes were seized and also that he helped the criminal escape from the crime scene and helped Sharma get rid of the corpse made him the co-accused.

Sushil Sharma fled to various cities thereafter (Jaipur, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore) finally surrendering in Bangalore on 10th July 1995.

The facts that have been established and agreed upon without a scope of doubt are as follows:-  
1) The appellant Sushil Sharma was the owner of a restaurant by the name of Bagia Bar-be-Que in the compound of Ashok Yatri Niwas at Ashoka Road, New Delhi and his co-accused Keshav Kumar was one of the employees kept there by Mr. Sharma.

2) On the night of 2nd July, 1995 (Sushil Sharma Vs The State of NCT of Delhi 2013) a body of a female was being burnt on the tandoor of the said Bagia Bar-be-Que by the appellant and his employee Keshav Kumar.

3) At the time of post-mortem examination of the charred corpse of that unfortunate woman bullets were noticed embedded in the skull and neck region and those bullets were found by the ballistic expert to have been fired from the .32” Arminus revolver which the appellant admittedly possessed during those days.

 4) The woman whose body was being burnt had met with homicidal death.

5) Appellant Sushil Sharma was living in flat, Mandir Marg, New Delhi with Naina Sahni d/o Shri Harbhajann Singh and Smt. Jaswant Kaur and both of them were seen together in the said flat in the evening of 2nd July, 1995 and after that day Naina Sahni was not seen alive by anyone.

6) Sushil Sharma was suspecting that Naina Sahni was having affairs with other person and Naina Sahni had started telling Sushil Sharma to declare publicly that they were husband and wife which he did not want to do and so he had a strong motive to kill her.

7). On 4th July, 1995 five fired cartridge cases of .32” and one lead bullet of .32” and some blood stained articles were recovered from flat, Mandir Marg, Gole Market, New Delhi and those cartridge cases and lead bullet were also found by the ballistic expert to have been fired from the licensed Arminus .32” revolver of Sushil Sharma and the blood on different articles was found to be of AB Group which was the blood group of Naina Sahni.

8) The appellant Sushil Sharma had after his arrest got recovered one blood stained kurta from the area of Rangpuri in Delhi while in police custody.

9) The charred corpse lifted from the tandoor of Bagia Bar-be-Que on the night of 2nd/3rd July, 1995 was found to be that of Naina Sahni. (Sushil Sharma Vs The State of NCT of Delhi 2013)[3]

IV. LEGAL AND STATUTORY ISSUES
The motive of the crime was on grounds of Sharma doubting his wife’s character. The Legal issue involved here was that the case was put up on the circumstantial evidence (DNA) and second autopsy. The accused was proved guilty on grounds of these only.
Strained interpersonal relationship between husband and wife led to the outrage, further sudden provocation, in a fit of rage which made him commit such a heinous crime.
Conspiracy to cause destruction of evidence of murder.
Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code says, when a criminal act is done by several person with that of a common intention of all, each of such person is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. Also Section 37 of IPC says intentional cooperation in a commission of an offence of another also constitutes an offence; which was the case with Sushil Sharma (the accused) and Keshav Kumar (restaurant employee).
Section 120 B of IPC talks about punishment of Criminal conspiracy. The very act of Keshav Kumar who helped Sharma burn the pieces of the corpse in the Tandoor constituted his facilitate the murder and later helped him flee from the crime scene, hence liable for punishment.
Keshav Kumar (the co-accused) who helped Sushil disappear from the restaurant and also helped him destroy the corpse was also charged under the Section 201 of IPC because he caused the disappearance of evidence with the intention of hiding Sushil from legal action and also he lied about the burning saying it to be old Congress posters, therefore gave an information to the police which was false.[4]
Sushil Sharma had a very smooth escape from the restaurant with the aid of Keshav Kumar which comes under Section 212 which says harboring an offender with the intention to screen him from legal punishment shall be punished as mentioned in the Section.
Punishment for murder under Section 302 of IPC which says whoever commits the murder is to be punished with death or imprisonment for life and will also be liable to fine.
V. GOVERNMENT WORK ON DEMOLISHING DOWRY       
Mahendra Nath Dass vs. State of Assam, AIR 1999 SC 1926: – In this case the convict killed the deceased with a sword, amputated the hand, cut the head off, and then took the dismantled body royally to the police station. Thereby, the Supreme Court held that the act was of extreme depravity and the accused is entitled for death penalty. In the present case of Naina Sahni, we find that even this was an act of extreme immorality; however, the Honorable Supreme Court chose to commute the death penalty awarded to Sushil Sharma.
Mohd.Chaman State (NCT of Delhi) SC 2000: – In this case the appellant has raped a one year old girl, who caused her injuries, ultimately leading to her death. The trial court though sentenced him with death penalty and the High Court confirming it, the Supreme Court held that the appellant was not a threat to the community and thereby set aside the death penalty and commuted to life imprisonment.
Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar vs. State of Maharashtra: – In this case, the appellant and others were in search of job and they planned to kidnap a friend of theirs, ask for ransom thereafter. Instead they ended up murdering him and cut his body to pieces and disposed it off to various places. One of the accused gave the evidence against the appellant thereby awarding him with death penalty. The High Court confirmed the death penalty. However, the judgment was overruled by the Supreme Court saying that the method of disposing the body does not include the case for the rarest of the rare principle and also there is scope of reformation on the part of the accused. Therefore, death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment. [5]
VI. ANALYSIS AND COMPARISION
Overview
Absence of cordial relationship- suspicion of extra marital affair on wife- regular beatings and spying by servant- Murder of wife- circumstantial evidence and motive- shot by revolver of the husband – after murder- body chopped and burnt in Tandoor – common intention and disappearance of evidence- hence the guilt proved- awarded death sentence by the Sessions Court and High Court- commuted to life imprisonment by the Supreme Court.[6]

Points to be pondered on
This was a clear case of homicidal death of a wife who was murdered by the husband in a fit of rage because of him doubting her having an affair. However the case took over a decade to bring out the proper judgment. The question which thus strikes in the minds of people would be “Why would such a case take that long to decide?” The answer is quite clear. Political influence always plays a vital role in this system. When the accused is the President of Delhi Youth Congress, it is pretty much evident that one might use his influence for turning the tables.
However, Sushil Sharma never denied the fact that he killed his wife; what he does deny that he chopped his wife to pieces and then burnt her in Tandoor. In an interview he said “That one day is blur in my life. Till today, I do not know what happened. It happened in a fraction of a second and that one second has cost me 20 years.”[7]
The repeated mentions of strained relationship between the accused and deceased went ahead to be an important parameter for the final judgment. The reason for tensions between the couple was that Sushil was reluctant to disclose their marriage and accept her as his wife publically, and the reason so given was that it would have affected his political career which is a very difficult to register. In any case, marriage can hardly spoil anyone’s political prospects. However, this was a strong motive behind the murder.
While there are media reports and news that Sushil Sharma happened to have chopped his wife, the Supreme Court order reads ‘…medical evidences medical evidence does not establish that the body was cut. There is also no recovery of any weapon like a chopper which could suggest that Sharma had cut the body… Murder was the outcome of a strained personal relationship.’ Sushil claims that it was the impact of heat that made her limbs fall apart and not the assumptions that he chopped the body.
The fact that the punishment was commuted from death sentence to that of life sentence makes it very difficult to accept. Sharma not only murdered his wife in a fit of a rage but also chopped it to pieces and burnt it in the Tandoor. While one might argue that there is no proof of him chopping the corpse since no such weapon was found while investigating, however there was a black polythene with blood stains of the deceased found at the crime scene (circumstantial evidence) which makes it believable and true.
While everybody debates about the validity and legality of Life Imprisonment, nobody seems to have noticed why such a decision is taken in any case.[8] Talking about Sushil Sharma, the method in which he planned to get rid of the body makes it brutal and shocking. What else can be ‘rarest of the rare’[9] than this? What else than chopping a body to pieces to burn in Tandoor can be brutal and rare?

The Supreme Court while ruling out the lower court’s judgment said, “Undoubtedly the offence is brutal but the brutality alone would not justify the death sentence in this case.”

So what does? Sharma’s appeal against the death sentence being entertained in the apex court brings the terrible question of just how inhuman and horrific a crime will have to be in the future to qualify as ‘rarest of rare’.[10]

Making headway to the next part of this report, are the judgments and the series of them which lead to commute the death penalty to life sentence.

VII. JUDGEMENT AND SUGGESTIONS
In 2003, Sharma was awarded with death penalty by a district court. He appealed in the Delhi High Court for the same where he found no mercy and the judgment of the Court said in 2007:

“People like the appellant who are power drunk and have no value for human life are definitely a menace for the society at large and deserve no mercy. … The act of the appellant is so abhorrent and dastardly that in case death penalty is not awarded to him it would be a mockery of justice and conscience of the society at large would be shocked. This is surely a case which falls within the category of ‘rarest of rare cases’ in which no other punishment except the death penalty would be justified.”[11]

What comes next it the Supreme Court’s judgment in 2014 stating:

“Undoubtedly the offence is brutal but the brutality alone would not justify the death sentence in this case.”

Is this judgment not a mockery of justice? Does this not shock the conscience of the society at large?

To this, the Supreme Court laid down a few criteria on which only if the crime falls will be eligible for awarding a death penalty.

“When the murder is committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community.”
“When the murder is committed for a motive which evinces total depravity and meanness…”[12]
Therefore, the present case where there was a murder and then methodical and calculated destruction of evidence by chopping and burning in Tandoor, according to the Supreme Court of India is not “extremely brutal,… revolting…” enough to provoke resentment among people.

The Supreme Court also concluded that Sharma’s motivation to murder was because he “loved” Sahni and was a possessive husband; the murder was the “outcome of strained personal relationship”. What happened to that “love” for his wife when he was brutally chopping her body into pieces? Where was the possessive husband when his wife was planning to move to Australia with the help of her colleague? Questions are many, but the judgment answers none.

The death sentence was commuted on other grounds as well. The bench observed that Sharma had no “criminal antecedents” and had chances of reformation. However, it is pretty unusual that Sharma’s repeated attempts of domestic cruelty (restrictions, abuse, etc) upon Naina Sahni do not count as criminal antecedents. The instances of domestic abuse were testified in the court by the domestic help, hence the validity of this argument. [13]

Had the police and the home guard not been alert on the night of 2nd July 1995, Sharma would have gotten away with the legal trial and punishment, owing to the fact that he had tried his best to do away with the corpse (evidence of murder). The crime had all the political influence one could ever think of.  In my personal opinion, it should also be the concern of the law makers to define the doctrine rarest of the rare, because in such high profile mitigating factors are many, however, its validity remains questionable.

VIII. CONCLUSION
Maybe it’s a trend or a practice, death sentence awarded by the trial court, confirmed by the High Court and finally commuted by the Supreme Court to life imprisonment.

The judiciary wing has always performed its functions at its best, but what happens when the Court of Law includes certain rules and provisions which might make one rethink on the reliability of the judgments; people end up taking crime for granted.

The order given to the Tandoor Murder Case resonates till date. The order goes on to conclude: “It appears that the appellant was extremely possessive of the deceased…the appellant (Sushil) suspected her fidelity and the murder was the result of this possessiveness” and was not an offence against society.[14] What is the definition of love which goes to such extent that it takes away the life of that person? Who decides the limit of possessiveness? Is that not a crime in itself, to limit one’s freedom? Can talking to the opposite sex enrage a person so bad that they end of shooting them? Questions like such will be unanswered and stab the conscience of the society.

Perhaps Sharma’s crime is not horrifying enough for it to be included in the rarest of the rare type. Perhaps we have become immune to crime owing to the fact that we are surrounded by so many of its kind. Perhaps we have become so used to killing and murder that life or death, does not really affect anymore.

Next time when visiting a restaurant having a Tandoor, it is advised to check the contents carefully. One might never know when a happy dinner time could turn into horrors.

      `
      Abstract
Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. was started under the chairmanship of a flamboyant industrialist, one of the biggest Indian liquor tycoons who claimed himself as the ‘King of Good Times’. The company garnered multiple accolades and achieved a growing market share in the aviation sector, presenting an attractive and innovative image. By providing passengers with exceptional comfort and an enjoyable flight experience, customer satisfaction soared. Despite its relatively short existence, the company left a notable and impactful mark on the Indian aviation industry. Losses have been reported ever since it started operating in 2005.1 For many years, it struggled with serious financial problems that ultimately forced the company to cease operations on 20 October 2012. Due to the reputation of its Chairman and Managing Director, several private and public sector banks in India extended loans to Kingfisher Airlines. Further, the airline struggled to incur maintenance, landing, and aviation costs. The employees and pilots staged strikes due to the non-payment of their owed salaries and dues. The collapse of Kingfisher Airlines is attributed to promoters’ inordinate overconfidence stemming from their past accomplishments, tunnel vision, and a weak business strategy. The current case examines the fall of Kingfisher Airlines from the strategic management and accounting manipulation perspective. It also outlines the causes contributing to the airline’s downfall.
Introduction
Indian aviation industry commenced its operations in December 1912. Since then, the industry has undergone a swift transformation. The provisions of the Air Corporations Act of 1953 governed Indian skies. As per the legislation, all existing airlines were nationalized. Two corporations, Air India and Indian Airlines were set up to provide effective, sufficient, affordable, and well-coordinated air transportation services domestically and internationally. However, later in 1990, the Indian government ended its monopoly by adopting an ‘open-sky’ policy, allowing air taxis to operate from any airport nationwide. By 1995, many private airlines were flying over Indian skies, such as Indigo, SpiceJet, Sahara, Jet, etc. From 2005 to 2011, the Indian airline industry saw explosive growth, witnessing a compound annual growth rate of 18% (Srinivasan & Prasad, 2014). However, the global financial crisis of 2008 caused industry growth rates to slow. Resultantly, the aviation industry experienced a difficult period due to unprecedented hikes in fuel prices, causing high operational expenses, turbulent financial markets, and a sluggish economy. The circumstances were much more challenging for the Indian airlines owing to high taxes and domestic regulations. Further, this period witnessed the worst phase of India’s one of the most profitable and second largest acquirers of domestic air travel market share—Kingfisher Airlines.
Kingfisher Airlines: Fly the Good Times
Background
Mr Vijay Mallya, one of the biggest Indian liquor tycoons, grew up in a privileged environment, inherited immense riches, and headed a ₹300 crore business. At the young age of 28, following his father Vittal Mallya’s demise, he took over the United Breweries group, a business valued at ₹300 crore. Additionally, Mallya established Kingfisher Airlines under his chairmanship. The United Breweries group, headquartered in Bengaluru, was the owner of the airline. In May 2005, the company began its operations2 with a fleet of four brand-new Airbus A320-200s, starting with a flight from Mumbai to Delhi (Pandey & Pandey, 2018). The airline had a vision of offering top-notch amenities, including comfortable seating, hot meals, personalized entertainment, and treating passengers as esteemed guests. Within a year, the airline expanded from operating just four daily flights to an impressive 104 flights per day. It swiftly connected 16 cities by introducing 17 additional aircraft.
The company also set a record in the years 2005 and 2007 for the swift airplane induction process. By 2006, the airline had attained a highly esteemed five-star status and had gained significant popularity among travellers belonging to the business class segment. In May 2007, the company acquired a loss-making airline, Air Deccan, at a cost amounting to ₹1,000 crores through United Breweries Group. The merger between the two was crucial to bypass government restrictions on international flights. The legislation permitted airlines with at least 5 years of operation to fly internationally. Without the merger, Kingfisher Airlines could not operate international flights until 2010. Gradually, in 2008 Kingfisher Airlines became the most significant operating airline in Indian skies. In September 2008, the airline expanded its operations globally by establishing a connection between Bengaluru and London. Subsequently, in 2009, Kingfisher Airlines received a prestigious five-star rating from Skytrax.3 Among the seven airlines that were honoured with this distinction, Kingfisher Airlines gradually expanded and emerged as the largest airline in the second-most populous country in the world. It commanded a significant 26.7% share of the domestic aviation market4 and operated approximately 250 flights per day.
During that time, the airline offered its guests the following classes of air travel: Kingfisher First: Premium services focused primarily on individuals who have the financial means to afford and enjoy premium-level services; Kingfisher Class: Premium Economy service catered to the trendy middle-class demographic who were experiencing upward social mobility; Kingfisher Red: Low-fare air travel focused on price-conscious middle-income group people. Kingfisher Elite: Focused on providing charter services; Kingfisher Cargo: Focused on delivering cargo services (Panigrahi et al., 2019).
The Turmoil
Kingfisher Airlines enjoyed a prominent position among India’s leading airlines until December 2011. However, it was unable to sustain its high standing over an extended period. Exceptional customer satisfaction came at the cost of profitability. Mr Mallya’s decision-making revolved around prioritizing luxury sales, but in India, only a limited number of individuals were willing to pay an extra amount for such luxurious offerings. Despite this, the airline excelled in terms of product quality and providing exceptional customer service, surpassing its competitors in these aspects.
Poor branding and positioning of Kingfisher Red were the primary reasons for the airline’s downfall. Kingfisher Red was introduced as a low-cost subsidiary of Kingfisher Airlines, targeting price-sensitive travellers. However, the target audience failed to resonate with it effectively. The airline established its brand image and reputation based on luxury and premium services, which became synonymous with the main brand. Introducing a low-cost subsidiary under the same brand umbrella created confusion among customers. Further, the marketing efforts and communication strategies for Kingfisher Red were not executed effectively. The airline failed to differentiate itself from competitors in the low-cost segment and was ineffective in communicating the unique value proposition of Kingfisher Red to potential customers. As a result, it struggled to attract a significant customer base and failed to generate the expected demand. The lack of clear brand identity and positioning, coupled with ineffective marketing and communication strategies, led to poor brand perception and limited customer appeal for Kingfisher Red.
Additionally, the merger of Kingfisher Airlines and Air Deccan served as a significant marketing factor that contributed to the downfall of the airline. The merger brought together two airlines with contrasting positioning in the market. Air Deccan was known as a low-cost carrier, catering to price-conscious travellers, while Kingfisher Airlines had established itself as a luxury airline, targeting premium customers. The merging of these two airlines with distinct market segments resulted in a dilution of brand identity and confusion among customers. The luxury image of Kingfisher Airlines clashed with the low-cost positioning of Air Deccan, making it challenging to effectively target and cater to the needs of both customer segments. This lack of alignment in brand positioning and target audience created challenges in marketing, as the merged entity struggled to communicate a clear and compelling value proposition to customers. The merger failed to leverage the strengths of both airlines and capitalize on their respective market positions. Furthermore, 366 domestic flights and 20 international flights were flown by the airlines. It also owned 67 aircraft, which increased aircraft lease rental. The hiked fuel prices and the economic slowdown of 2008 caused high losses and heavy debts, leading the company to shut down its operations by the end of 2012.
Since its inception, the airline has faced losses that piled up subsequently.5 Mr Mallya’s emphasis on offering luxurious travel experiences resulted in the incorporation of state-of-the-art facilities onboard, consequently increasing the airline’s operational costs. To support this luxury-focused approach, the airline acquired a diverse fleet of aircraft through purchases or leases. However, this decision led to additional expenses in terms of depreciation costs and lease rents.
The company faced difficulties in coping with the escalating price of jet fuel due to the growing demand for fuel and intense competition among airlines to operate at a low cost. The continuous rise in fuel prices posed a significant challenge for the company in meeting its financial obligations in this regard. It acquired many aircraft for billions of dollars, including Airbus A330-200s, A350-800s, A380s, and ATR-72-500s. Further, the merger with Air Deccan resulted in the inheritance of additional models. The piled-up lease rental crossed ₹984 crores, leading to the grounding of 66 aircraft. The economic downturn of 2008 served as another external factor that contributed to the downfall of Kingfisher Airlines. A lack of proper management and maturity to handle such a big airline business affected the airlines greatly. Mr Mallya experienced a significant financial loss of ₹ 9,091.4 crores and accumulated loans from 17 different banks. The State Bank of India was the largest creditor, with a debt amounting to ₹ 1,600 crores, followed by IDBI Bank and Punjab National Bank, each owed ₹ 800 crores by the airline. Additional debts include ₹ 650 crores to Bank of India, ₹ 550 crores to Bank of Baroda, ₹ 410 crores to Central Bank of India, ₹ 320 crores to UCO Bank, ₹ 310 crores to Corporation Bank, and ₹ 430 crores to United Bank of India. In the fiscal year 2012–2013, the reported revenue of the airline stood at ₹ 683.4 crores, while it incurred a substantial loss of ₹ 4,301.4 crores. At this moment, the airline was ‘bleeding money’, and the shortage of funds resulted in non-payment of salaries to employees.
Owing to mounting challenges and obstacles encountered by the airline, it was compelled to suspend its operations in February 2012, subsequently facing suspension by the International Air Transport Association. Later in October 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation suspended the company’s Scheduled Operator’s Permit.6 Following this, the Central Government discontinued the flight entitlement in February 2013, effectively shuttering the airlines. Financial institutions and leasing companies instigated actions to acquire custody of the airbuses. Ultimately, Mr Mallya fled the country with over ₹ 9,000 crores of debt.7
Reasons Behind the Downfall
Kingfisher Airlines was one of the top five airlines in India till December 2011.8 However, following significant losses and debt, the company eventually went out of business in 2012.
Earnings Management Practices Adopted
Due to the surge in crude oil prices and the economic slowdown of 2008, most airlines started reporting losses, resulting in poor performance. Kingfisher differentiated from its competitors because of unparalleled premium world-class airline services to its guests. Shortly, issues of high operational costs and diminishing returns came to light. Owing to piling financial pressures and the inability of the airline to manage its operations effectively, lenders requested to pay off all debts before applying for additional loans. By December 2011, the net loss rose to ₹ 444.27 crores from ₹ 253.69 crores in the previous year’s third quarter.
Exhibit 2 shows a continuous rise in total assets by 10,662.7%; revenues grew by 8,551.04%, and property, plant, and equipment rose by 4,752.89% from FY04 to FY12. Conversely, most years showed a negative value of total accruals with an average of −583.807, indicating the company’s engagement in income-decreasing (i.e., depreciation expenditure) manipulation of earnings through accruals. The company either purchased or leased all fleets, which led to the accumulation of lease rents and depreciation expenses. Due to the higher-than-expected lease rental amounting to ₹ 984 crores, 66 aircraft were grounded in 2011.
Further, the company offered discounted tickets to boost sales.9 It grew by 8,711.96% from FY04 to FY12. Manipulating earnings through real activities reduces firm value in the long run, considering the actions taken to boost earnings in the present can negatively impact cash flows in the future. Moreover, providing discounts to customers can create an expectation of future discounts, which may result in reduced sales margins. The airline gained a competitive edge by offering superior products and exceptional customer service. It provided premium amenities such as hot meals, comfortable seating, and personalized entertainment, and treated passengers with the utmost hospitality, considering them as valued guests. However, the airline could not sustain itself by providing such luxury travel at a discounted fare, resulting in negative cash flows and mounting losses.
Structural Problems
Mr Mallya has a history of acting extravagantly. The airline made mistakes with the types of aircraft it purchased, resulting in capital expenditures that did not generate a profit. The whole fleet of Kingfisher Airlines was either owned or leased in 2005, which piled up the lease rent amounting to ₹ 984 crores. The company acquired most airbuses following the ‘buy-and-leaseback’ model.10 including Airbus A330-200s, A350-800s, A380s, and ATR-72-500s. It owned 67 aircraft (64 leased and three owned). After merging with Air Deccan, it inherited more models from it. However, other companies had a mixture of new and old aircraft, which reduced maintenance and operating costs. Significant structural inefficiency once again highlighted the absence of strategic management skills, as he did not exhibit any interest in researching or benchmarking competitors.
Operational Problems
Since the beginning, Kingfisher Airlines has incurred substantial operational costs. The merger with Air Deccan further dragged the resources. It necessitated taking over the business model adopted by Air Deccan based on European airlines (namely, EasyJet and Ryanair). In 2009, the company fired over 100 pilots and increased its fares substantially due to significant losses. By the fall of 2010, it began falling behind on airport payments. Further, service tax payments were delayed until December 2011. By the start of 2012, the company began to cancel its flights frequently. The flight maintenance, landing, and navigation expenses accounted for roughly 10.86% of its total revenue. Due to unpaid salaries, employees and pilots started protesting in March 2012. Around the same time, the company also started losing its independent directors.
Moreover, the engineers declined to certify the take-off and unpaid lease rentals resulted in the repossession of its aircraft by June 2012. The airline could not keep any promises, and payments to banks, airports, employees, pilots, and oil companies continued to rise as the interest burden kept mounting. By the end of 2012, the majority of its creditors and suppliers had not been paid, and the company was on the verge of losing its airline operating permit. Living in denial and keeping an outward appearance of ‘all is well’ allowed things to deteriorate for too long. Mr Mallya might have been able to save Kingfisher Airlines if he had recognized these warning signs and acted upon them in time.
Strategic Issues
Inappropriate decision-making and an opaque business model led Kingfisher Airlines to collapse11. Mr Mallya could not understand consumer needs and made all his decisions to provide luxury travel. Only a handful of Indians were ready to pay for luxury travel for domestic routes (Pathak, 2015). The merger with a loss-making, low-cost airline Air Deccan at the cost of ₹ 1,000 crores, showed no business prudence. Furthermore, the rebranding of Air Deccan as Kingfisher Red in 2008 led customers to expect a certain level of service, similar to the full benefits offered by Kingfisher, which a low-cost airline could not provide. Due to this, both Kingfisher Red and Kingfisher received negative feedback from customers. Competing airlines increased profitability by eliminating services that customers would not value anyway. The high fuel cost, airport user fees, and the mandate to fly on several unprofitable routes had already created constraints and problems for the company. Even though Mr Mallya was aware of these restrictions, he made no effort to create a business strategy that took them into account. Therefore, Kingfisher’s extravagant business model became unsustainable.`
